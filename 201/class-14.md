## CSS Transforms

### What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

The CSS transform property allows a developer to perform a number of different actions on an element that changes 
how that element appears in the browser. These actions include:

* **Moving the element:** The `translate()` function allows us to move an element around on the screen. We can specify 
  the amount to move the element in pixels or percentages.

* **Rotating the element:** The `rotate()` function allows us to rotate an element around its center point. We can specify 
  the angle of rotation in degrees.

* **Scaling the element:** The `scale()` function allows us to scale an element up or down. We can specify the amount to 
  scale the element by as a percentage.

* **Skew the element:** The `skew()` function allows us to skew an element along the horizontal or vertical axis. We can 
  specify the amount of skew in degrees.

### Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.

Here is an example of a transform and how it could be used on a website:

```
.my-element {
  transform: translate(100px, 50px);
}
```
This code will translate the element with the class `my-element` 100 pixels to the right and 50 pixels down. This means that 
the element will be moved to a new location on the page.

## CSS Transitions & Animations

### What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?

A CSS transition allows a developer to change the value of a CSS property smoothly over a period of time. This can be used to 
create a variety of effects.

### How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

Here is a table summarizing the key differences between CSS animations and transitions:

| Feature                 | CSS Transition                | CSS Animation               |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Complexity              | Simple                        | More complex                |
| Loops                   | Single play                   | Can loop infinitely         |
| Triggering              | Mostly event-based (e.g., hover) | Can be both time-based (at certain intervals) and event-based |
| Code                    | Uses `transition` property    | Uses `animation` property   |
| Control                 | Limited                       | Full keyframe control       |
| Intermediate States     | Automatically generated       | Must be manually defined    |
| Back and Forth Movement | No built-in support, must trigger another transition manually | Supported via `alternate` animation-direction |
