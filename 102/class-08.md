# Operators and Loops

#### What is an `expression` in JavaScript?

An expression in JavaScript is a piece of code that produces a value. It can 
be a combination of variables, operators, and function calls that are evaluated 
to produce a resulting value.

#### Why would we use a loop in our code?

We use loops in our code to execute a block of code repeatedly. It allows us to 
automate repetitive tasks and iterate over a collection of data or perform a 
certain action until a specific condition is met. Without loops, we would have to 
manually repeat the same code multiple times.

#### When does a `for` loop stop executing?

A for loop in JavaScript stops executing when the loop condition evaluates to 
false. The loop condition is checked before each iteration. The loop executes 
as long as the condition is true, and it stops when the condition becomes false.

#### How many times will a `while` loop execute?

The number of times a while loop executes depends on the condition specified in 
the loop. A while loop continues executing the code block as long as the condition 
evaluates to true. If the condition initially evaluates to false, the code block 
inside the loop will not be executed at all.

### **Summary**

***

In JavaScript, an expression is a code snippet that produces a value. Loops are 
used in programming to repeatedly execute a block of code. They are essential for 
automating repetitive tasks and iterating over data or performing actions until 
a certain condition is satisfied. A `for` loop in JavaScript stops executing when 
its loop condition becomes false, which is checked before each iteration. On the 
other hand, a `while` loop continues executing as long as its condition remains true 
and stops when the condition evaluates to false. The number of iterations in a 
while loop can vary based on the condition specified within it.
