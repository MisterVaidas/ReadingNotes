# Programing with JavaScript

#### What is `control flow`?

Control flow refers to the order in which the statements or instructions of a 
program are executed. It determines the path a program takes from start to 
finish based on conditions and decisions. Control flow statements, such as 
`if`-`else` statements, `loops`, and `switch` statements, are used to control 
the flow of execution in a program.

#### What is a JavaScript `function`?

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. 
A function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed 
by parentheses `()`. The code to be executed by the function is placed inside curly 
brackets `{}`. Functions are reusable in that they can be invoked any number of 
times within a code.

#### What does it mean to `invoke` - or `call` - a function?

Invoking or calling a function in JavaScript means to execute the code within the 
function. When a function is invoked, the program jumps to the function code, 
executes it, and then returns to the point where the function was called.

#### What are the parenthesis `()` for when you define a function?

In JavaScript, when defining a function, the parentheses `()` are used to hold any 
parameters the function might need. Parameters are like placeholders that 
represent the input the function expects when it's called.

#### **Summary**

***

**Control flow refers to the order in which statements are executed in a program. 
JavaScript functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. 
Invoking or calling a function means executing its code. When defining a function, 
parentheses `()` are used to indicate the parameter list, allowing you to specify 
the values the function expects to receive.**
