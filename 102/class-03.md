and push those changes back to the remote repository when we are ready.

In Git, we can track and stage files using the **git add** command. This command adds 
files to the staging area, which is a preparatory step before commiting changes.

## Summary

***

Version control is a crucial tool for managing and tracking changes to files. Git, a popular 
version control system, allows us to clone remote repositories, track and stage files using 
the **git add** command, take snapshots of changes with the **git commit** command, and send 
changes to GitHub using the **git push** command. These commands enable collaboration, history 
tracking, and efficient code management, ensuring that projects can be easily maintained, 
shared, and reverted when needed.
