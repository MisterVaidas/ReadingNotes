# Design web pages with CSS

### What is the purpose of CSS?

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used in web development 
to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.

Here are some of its main purposes:

* Separation of Content from Presentation
* Improving Website Accessibility
* Consistency Across Webpages
* Reducing Load Times
* Advanced Styling Options
* Responsive Design

### What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?

There are three ways to insert CSS into web project: 

1. **Inline CSS:** This method involves adding the CSS directly to the HTML tags 
    using the "style" attribute.

2. **Internal CSS:** This method involves adding the CSS in the `<style>` tags within
    the `<head>` section of the HTML document.

3. **External CSS:** This is the most common method for inserting CSS. It involves
    creating a separate `.css` file and linking in to the HTML document.

### Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all `<p>` elements red text.

The simple CSS rule that would set text color of all `<p>` elements to red should
look like this:

```css
p {
  color: red;
}
```
