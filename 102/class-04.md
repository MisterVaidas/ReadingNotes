# Structure web pages with HTML

### What is HTML and why do we use it?

HTML, which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, is the standard markup
language used for creating and structuring the content of web pages. HTML is 
used to define the structure and presentation of the content on a webpage.

### What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?

The three main parts of an HTML element are:

1. **Opening Tag:** This is the beginning of an HTML element and is enclosed
    in angle brackets (<>). It defines the start of the element and usually
    contains the name of the element.
2. **Content:** This is the actual content of data that is placed between the
    opening and closing tags of an HTML element. It can be text, images, links,
    or other types of content.
3. **Closing Tag:** This is the end of an HTML element and is also enclosed in
    angle brackets. It marks the end of the element. 

### What is it called when you give an element extra information?

When we give an element extra information, is called **atributes**. HTML atributes
provide additional details or instructions about an element. Atributes used to
modify the behavior or appearance of the element.

### What is a semantic element?

A semantic element in HTML is a tag that provides meaning or context to the content
within it. Semantic elements describe the purpose or role of the content, making it
more understandable. Examples of semantic elements: `header`, `nav`, `section`,
`article`, `footer`, and `main`.
