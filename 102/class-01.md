# Learning Markdown

### What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to format plain text. It provides a  
simple and readable way to add formatting elements to documents without the need for  
complex HTML or formatting tools. Markdown files typically have the file extension ".md" or  
".markdown".  

### Why do we use Markdown?

Markdown is widely used because of its simplicity and versatility. It allows users to easily  
create structured documents that can be converted into various formats such as HTML, PDF,  
or Rich Text Format. It is commonly used for creating documentation, writing blog posts,  
formatting readme files on platforms like GitHub, and taking notes.  

### What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?

To create a heading in Markdown, we use the "#" symbol. The number of "#" symbols we  
use determines the level of the heading, with one "#" creating the largest heading and six "#"  
creating the smallest heading.  
  
For example:  
* One "#" creates a level 1 heading: # Heading 1
* Two "##" create a level 2 heading: ## Heading 2
* Three "###" create a level 3 heading: ### Heading 3
* And so on, up to six "######" for a level 6 heading: ###### Heading 6

### When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?

To make text bold or italicized for emphasis in Markdown, we can use the following symbols:

* To make text **bold**, we can use double asterisks ( ** text ** ) or double underscores ( __ text __ ).
* To make text *italicized*, we can use single asterisks ( * text * ) or single underscores ( _ text _ ).

### How do you create a link with Markdown?

To create a link in Markdown, we use the following syntax: [link text] (url). We  
replace link text with the text we want to display as the link, and url with the actual  
URL we want the link to point to.  

For example: [Tech Educators website] (https://www.techeducators.co.uk)  
will create a link that displays as **"Tech Educators website"** and leads to [www.techeducators.co.uk](https://techeducators.co.uk/).  

### What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?

To create an unordered (bulleted) list in Markdown, we can use one of the following symbols:

* Asterisk ( * )
* Plus sign ( + )
* Minus sign ( - )

We use the chosen symbol, followed by a space, and then the list item text. 

### Summary

 **With Markdown, we can create headings, edit text, create links, and format lists  
 using intuitive symbols and syntax. Markdown can be a valuable toll for enchancing the  
 readability and presentation of text-based content.**
