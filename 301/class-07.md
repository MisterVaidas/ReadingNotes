# Readings: NODE.JS

## An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

### What is node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It's a popular choice for building real-time web applications, data-intensive applications, and APIs.

### In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

V8 allows web browsers to communicate with JavaScript code. When a web browser encounters JavaScript code, it passes the code to V8. V8 then translates the JavaScript code into machine code and executes the machine code. This allows the web browser to understand and respond to the JavaScript code.

### What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

Node.js being a "JavaScript runtime" means it's a program that lets you run JavaScript on your computer or server, not just in your web browser. You can use Node.js to write applications using JavaScript that do things like respond to web requests, interact with databases, and even read and write files on a computer's hard drive.

### What is npm?

npm (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript. It is the default package manager for Node.js. npm is used to install, update, and manage JavaScript packages.

### What version of node are you running on your machine?

To check what version of `node` i running on my machine, i need to enter following command in my terminal: 

```
node -v

```

The version of `node` on my machine is:

```
v18.16.0

```

### What version of npm are you running on your machine?

To check what version of `npm` i running on my machine, i need to enter following command in my terminal:

```
npm -v

```

The version of `npm` on my machine is:

```
9.5.1

```

### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

To install the `jshint` library/package, I can use the following command:

```
npm install jshint

```

### What is node used for?

Here are some of the things that Node.js can be used for:

* **Building real-time web applications**. Node.js is ideal for building real-time web applications that need to handle a lot of concurrent traffic.

* **Building data-intensive applications**. Node.js is well-suited for building data-intensive applications that need to process large amounts of data quickly.

* **Building APIs**. Node.js is a popular choice for building APIs. APIs are used to expose data or functionality to other applications.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

### What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

Here are the 6 reasons for pair programming:

1. **Improved code quality**. When two developers work together, they can more easily spot potential problems in the code.

2. **Faster development time**. Pair programming can actually lead to faster development time. This is because two developers can work on the code simultaneously.

3. **Better communication**. Pair programming can help to improve communication between developers.

4. **Increased knowledge sharing**. Pair programming can help to increase knowledge sharing among developers. This is because the two developers must share their knowledge in order to work together effectively.

5. **Greater code ownership**. When two developers work together on a piece of code, they both feel a sense of ownership over it.

6. **Improved morale and productivity**. Pair programming can help to improve morale and productivity among developers. This is because it can be a more enjoyable and stimulating way to work.

### In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

Most beneficial for me i found knowledge sharing and greater code ownership.

### How does pair programming work?

Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
